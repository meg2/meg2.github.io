	<h2>Margaret (Meg) Ayoub</h2>
	I received a Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in Human Resource Management from Sacred Heart University in May 2017.
<br><br>
Currently, I am continuing my education at Sacred Heart University and pursuing a Master's of Science in Human Resource Management at the Jack Welch School of Business.
<br><br>
I am extremely organized and hardworking. I am proficient in all Microsoft Office applications and am interested in utilizing technology for recruiting. Through my internship positions, I have learned creative ways to challenge, engage and support employees.

In college, I have been a member of the Dance Ensemble all four years. I am a member of the Business Administration Club. In my free time, I enjoy sailing and yoga.
